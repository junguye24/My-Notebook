## Reflection Document

### 01 - HTML

In this section, I watched the videos and followed them to complete the exercises.
The exercises in this section were quite helpful since it was sort of my first
time working with HTML so it was a great starter to learning HTML and seeing
how things work. All exercises were equally helpful. It was nice to be able
to write some code and then see the webpage change from the code I added
or modified.

### 02 - Accessibility

In this section, I used the solutions from the video to complete the
exercise. This exercise was helpful because it helped me learn how
to use the WAVE extension and how to view the errors. After seeing the
errors, it was nice to see where the errors or warnings occurred and
after learning about the errors and fixing them, it was helpful to
see whether or not I fixed these accessibility issues or not just by
using WAVE on the site.

### 03 - CSS

For this section, I completed the exercises by watching and following the
videos. Every exercise from this section were extremely helpful. I never worked
with CSS before so it was insightful to be able to learn the usage of
CSS with HTML. I thought it was very cool to see how you can format
text and also its positioning, colors, etc. Although every exercise in this
section were helpful, I think the 06-media-queries exercise was the most
helpful and useful. It was cool learning how to use media queries and
also making a nav bar, since nav bars are very useful for a lot of
different webpages.

### 04 - Flexbox

For this section, I followed along with the video to complete this
exercise. The exercises in this section was also very useful. I didn't
know about flexbox's and how to use it. It was helpful see the different
ways you can position the flexitems and how you can do so in CSS. But
after seeing how you can position the flex items inside the container,
it seems quite simple.

### 05 - CSS Grid

In this section, I watched the videos to complete this exercise. Both of
the exercises in this section was quite useful. It was nice to see the
ways you can position the grid items. It kind of looks similar to the flex
box in my opinion. But the way you position them in CSS is different.

### 06 - Bootstrap

In this section, I followed along the video to complete the exercises.
I think the cards exercise seems the most useful and interesting so far
in this section. You can modify the cards to whatever you want the card
content to be and you can also make each card have functionalities, such
as that "click me" button on each card. ALthough there is no functionality
or purpose of that button in that exercise, it is also cool to know that
you can make the buttons have a purpose!

### 07 - Javascript

In this section, I completed the exercises while watching the videos and
seeing the solutions. I don't think I've worked with JavaScript prior to
this so it was nice to see how simple it really is and also seeing what
you can do with it. All of the exercises in this section was very useful,
but I think the fetch exercise in this section seemed to be the most
useful, since it was nice to see how you can structure the page content
in JS without using a CSS file to do so.

### 08 - Jquery

In this section, I followed along with the videos to complete the exercises.
This section was quite useful and I learned a bit with using the '$' and
how to use it. After doing the exercises, I think it was quite simple and
not too complicated using the jQuery selectors.
